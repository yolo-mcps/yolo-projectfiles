# Write Tool Improvements Summary

## Overview
The write tool has been significantly enhanced to work harmoniously with the read and edit tools, forming a cohesive set of file manipulation tools with consistent behavior and complementary features.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Documentation
- Restructured documentation to match the exemplary format of read, edit, process, and kill tools
- Added comprehensive examples covering all use cases
- Added "When to use" guidance for dry_run and show_diff modes
- Included integration notes explaining how read/write/edit work together

### 2. New Features

#### Dry Run Mode (`dry_run: true`)
- Preview what would be written without actually modifying files
- Useful for testing operations and verifying paths
- Shows "Would write" in the operation message

#### Show Diff Mode (`show_diff: true`) 
- Displays a colored unified diff when overwriting existing files
- Uses the same theme system as the edit tool
- Truncates large diffs to 100 lines for readability
- Does not apply to append operations

#### Follow Symlinks (`follow_symlinks: true`)
- Explicit control over symlink behavior (default: true)
- Matches the behavior of the read tool for consistency
- Ensures security by validating resolved paths stay within project

#### Force Mode (`force: true`)
- Override the 100MB file size safety limit
- Prevents accidental creation of extremely large files
- Clear error message when limit is exceeded without force

#### Include Metadata (`include_metadata: true`)
- Returns detailed operation information in JSON format
- Includes: operation type, path, sizes, encoding, timestamps, backup info
- Useful for programmatic processing of results

### 3. Improved Path Resolution
- Now uses the same `resolve_path_for_read` utility as the read tool
- Consistent behavior across all three tools (read/write/edit)
- Better handling of new files and parent directory creation

### 4. Enhanced Output
- Operation type clearly indicated: "Created", "Wrote", "Appended", or "Would write"
- Better formatting using utility functions (`format_size`, `format_path`)
- Colored diff output that respects terminal capabilities

### 5. Safety Improvements
- File size limit check (100MB default, overridable with force)
- Maintains the existing safety check requiring files to be read before overwriting
- Dry run mode allows safe testing of operations

## Integration with Read and Edit Tools

### Workflow Examples

1. **View → Modify → Save**
   ```bash
   # Read to understand current content
   read config.json
   
   # Make precise edits
   edit config.json "debug: false" "debug: true"
   
   # Or completely replace
   write config.json "{ new content }" --show-diff
   ```

2. **Safe Overwrites**
   ```bash
   # Preview changes before writing
   write important.conf "new config" --dry-run
   
   # See what will change
   write important.conf "new config" --show-diff
   
   # Create backup before overwriting
   write important.conf "new config" --backup
   ```

3. **Consistent Symlink Handling**
   - All three tools support `follow_symlinks` parameter
   - Same security checks and path resolution logic
   - Predictable behavior across the toolset

## Testing
- Comprehensive test coverage for all new features
- Tests verify dry_run, show_diff, metadata, and force modes
- Symlink security tests updated to work with new parameters
- All existing tests continue to pass

## Breaking Changes
None - all new parameters are optional with sensible defaults.

## Future Considerations
- Line range support for partial file updates (similar to read's line_range)
- Integration with version control for automatic commits
- Template support for common file types
- Batch operations for multiple files
