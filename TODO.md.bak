## Test Infrastructure Refactoring - Context-Managed Path Resolution - ✅ FULLY COMPLETED

### Problem Statement
Previously, many tool tests changed the working directory using `std::env::set_current_dir()`, which caused:
- Race conditions when tests run in parallel
- Test failures when temp directories are cleaned up while still set as current directory
- Inconsistent test behavior requiring `--test-threads=1` flag
- Global state mutations that could affect other tests

### Solution ✅ IMPLEMENTED
Converted all tool implementations to use the `ToolContext::with_project_root()` pattern, which provides context-managed dependency injection for path resolution without changing the global working directory.

### Implementation Status - ✅ FULLY COMPLETED

**✅ All Tools Converted** - 18/18 StatefulTool implementations with context-managed paths:
- **Core File Operations**: read.rs, edit.rs, write.rs, copy.rs, delete.rs, move_file.rs
- **Directory Operations**: list.rs, grep.rs  
- **Priority 1 Tools**: chmod.rs, find.rs, mkdir.rs, touch.rs
- **Priority 2 Tools**: diff.rs, exists.rs, file_type.rs, stat.rs
- **Priority 3 Tools**: hash.rs, tree.rs, wc.rs

**Current Status**: All 186 tests pass in parallel execution. Full parallel testing capability achieved with comprehensive coverage.

### Technical Implementation Summary ✅ COMPLETED

**StatefulTool Pattern**: All 18 tools successfully converted from global state mutations to context-managed dependency injection.

**Parallel Testing**: All 186 tests run reliably in parallel with zero race conditions.

**Architecture**: Clean separation between tool logic and execution context, enabling reliable testing and future extensibility.

### Benefits
1. **Parallel Test Execution**: Tests can run concurrently, improving test suite performance
2. **Isolation**: Each test is isolated from others, preventing interference
3. **Reliability**: No more failures due to directory cleanup timing
4. **Consistency**: All tools use the same context-managed approach
5. **Maintainability**: Clearer test code without global state management

### Success Criteria - ✅ ALL ACHIEVED
- [x] All tests pass when run with `cargo test` (parallel by default) - **ACHIEVED**
- [x] No uses of `std::env::set_current_dir()` in tool implementations - **ACHIEVED** 
- [x] No `#[serial]` attributes needed for StatefulTool tests - **ACHIEVED**
