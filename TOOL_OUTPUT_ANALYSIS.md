## General Observations

### Positive Patterns
1. Most tools provide clear success/failure messages
2. Good use of type indicators ([FILE], [DIR])
3. Consistent error handling with tool-specific prefixes
4. Many tools show counts and statistics
5. Good handling of edge cases (empty results, identical files)

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Consistency**: Some tools use JSON (stat), others use plain text
2. **Verbosity Control**: Limited options to control output detail level
3. **Progress Indication**: No progress for long operations
4. **Highlighting**: No color/emphasis for important information
5. **Summaries**: Many tools could benefit from summary statistics
6. **Metadata**: File operations often lack size/count information

### Recommendations
1. **Output Format Standardization**
   - Add a consistent `--format` option across all tools (json/text/simple)
   - Default to human-readable text for interactive use
   - JSON for programmatic use

2. **Verbosity Control**
   - Add consistent `--verbose` and `--quiet` flags
   - Verbose: show additional details (metadata, timestamps, etc.)
   - Quiet: minimal output (just essential information)

3. **Progress Indication**
   - Add progress bars for long operations (copy, move, delete with patterns)
   - Show ETA for large file operations
   - Allow progress to be disabled with `--no-progress`

4. **Enhanced Feedback**
   - Show before/after states for modifications (chmod, touch)
   - Add size/count summaries for file operations
   - Include timing information for operations

5. **Safety and Preview**
   - Add `--dry-run` mode for destructive operations
   - Show preview of changes before execution
   - Add `--interactive` mode for confirmations

6. **Consistency Improvements**
   - Standardize success message formats
   - Use consistent type indicators across tools
   - Align summary line formats

7. **Additional Information**
   - Add operation duration to all tools
   - Show relative times where appropriate
   - Include more contextual metadata

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Core UX improvements)
1. Standardize output formats with --format option
2. Add consistent verbosity controls
3. Improve file operation feedback (sizes, counts)
4. Add progress indication for long operations

### Medium Priority (Enhanced functionality)
1. Add dry-run modes
2. Implement before/after state display
3. Add operation timing
4. Standardize error messages

### Low Priority (Nice-to-have)
1. Color output support
2. Interactive confirmations
3. Alternative output styles
4. Extended metadata options
