# Hash Tool Enhancement Ideas

## Potential Future Enhancements for Agentic LLMs

### 1. Multiple File Hashing
**Priority: High**
- Allow hashing multiple files in a single operation
- Return structured results with file paths and their hashes
- Useful for batch verification and build artifact checking

Example usage:
```json
{
  "paths": ["src/*.rs", "Cargo.toml", "Cargo.lock"],
  "algorithm": "sha256"
}
```

### 2. Checksum File Support
**Priority: High**
- Read and verify against standard checksum files (.sha256sum, .md5sum)
- Generate checksum files in standard format
- Support both reading and writing checksum files

Example usage:
```json
{
  "path": "checksums.sha256",
  "operation": "verify"
}
```

### 3. Hash Comparison
**Priority: Medium**
- Compare two files by their hashes without revealing content
- Return boolean result or detailed comparison
- Useful for detecting file changes or duplicates

Example usage:
```json
{
  "file1": "config.json",
  "file2": "config.backup.json",
  "algorithm": "sha256"
}
```

### 4. Directory Hashing
**Priority: Medium**
- Calculate hash of entire directory structure
- Include file metadata (names, permissions) in hash
- Useful for verifying directory integrity

### 5. Streaming Hash Updates
**Priority: Low**
- For very large files, provide progress updates
- Less relevant for LLMs but useful for UI feedback

## Implementation Notes

The current hash tool uses a simple implementation. For production use, consider:
- Using proper crypto libraries (sha2, md5 crates)
- Implementing streaming for large files
- Adding benchmarks for performance optimization
- Supporting additional algorithms (BLAKE2, SHA3)

## Current Strengths

The hash tool already has:
- ✅ Excellent test coverage (14 tests)
- ✅ Support for all major hash algorithms
- ✅ Proper symlink handling
- ✅ Clear error messages
- ✅ Well-structured output format
