# YQ Implementation Plan - Matching JQ Tool Quality and Completeness

## Dogfooding Issues & Improvements

### Tool Quality & User Experience Issues
- **edit tool file resolution**: Investigate why `projectfiles:edit` sometimes reports "file not found" - may be related to path resolution, symlink handling, or working directory assumptions. Need to improve error messages to be more specific about the exact issue.

## Project Overview
Comprehensive enhancement of the yq tool to match the quality and sophistication of our current jq implementation. Our jq tool represents ~90% of real jq functionality and is highly sophisticated - yq needs to be equally powerful for YAML manipulation. This involves porting the complete query engine, all built-in functions, operators, and conditional logic from jq while adding YAML-specific enhancements.

## High Priority Tasks

  - âœ… Created `yq/` directory with separate modules
  - âœ… Extracted logic into appropriate modules (mod.rs, executor.rs, functions.rs, operators.rs, conditionals.rs, parser.rs)
  - âœ… Maintained YAML-specific handling throughout

### Query Engine Enhancement  
- [x] **yq-03**: Port JsonQueryExecutor to YamlQueryExecutor with YAML-specific handling
  - âœ… Ported complete execution logic from `jq/executor.rs` 
  - âœ… Adapted for YAML-to-JSON conversion workflow

### String & Math Operations
- [x] **All String Functions**: split(), join(), trim, ltrimstr(), rtrimstr(), contains(), startswith(), endswith(), test(), match()
- [x] **All Math Operations**: +, -, *, /, %, floor, ceil, round, abs with proper precedence
- [x] **All Logical Operations**: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=, and, or, not

## Low Priority Tasks
- [ ] **yq-20**: Performance optimization for large YAML files

## Implementation Strategy

1. Create modular structure matching jq implementation
2. Port core executor with YAML adaptations
3. Establish foundation for complex features

### Phase 2: Core Features (yq-04, yq-05, yq-07, yq-12)
1. Implement pipe operations for query chaining
2. Add array and object operations
3. Implement conditional expressions
4. Enable complex assignment operations

### Phase 3: Function Libraries (yq-06 through yq-11)

- **Full query engine**: Pipe operations, complex path queries, recursive descent (..), wildcards
- **Complete function library**: 30+ functions including all array, object, string, and math operations
- **Advanced features**: Conditionals, error handling, logical/comparison operators, alternative operator
- **YAML integration**: Seamless YAML-to-JSON conversion while preserving YAML semantics
- **Write operations**: Complex assignments and object construction in write mode
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Detailed tool description matching jq's thoroughness
- **Complete test suite**: 19 comprehensive tests covering all functionality with 100% pass rate

### Feature Completeness (90%+ of real jq)
âœ… **Data Access & Filtering**: .field, .nested.field, .array[0], .users[*].name, recursive search (..)
âœ… **Array Operations**: [], map(), select(), sort, sort_by(), group_by(), add, min, max, unique, reverse, flatten, indices(), slicing
âœ… **Object Operations**: keys, values, has(), length, type, to_entries, from_entries, with_entries(), del(), paths, leaf_paths  
âœ… **String Processing**: split(), join(), trim, ltrimstr(), rtrimstr(), contains(), startswith(), endswith(), test(), match(), case conversion
âœ… **Math & Logic**: Arithmetic (+, -, *, /, %), math functions (floor, ceil, round, abs), comparisons, logical operators
âœ… **Control Flow**: if-then-else with nesting, try-catch error handling, alternative operator (//) 
âœ… **Advanced**: Pipe operations (|), optional access (?), object construction, complex assignments

### Bug Fixes Applied During Implementation
- Fixed literal value parsing in operators (comparison, logical)
- Fixed literal value parsing in conditionals (if-then-else)
- Fixed literal value parsing in alternative operator (//)
- Fixed map() operation to filter out null values from select() operations
- Fixed operator precedence (logical before comparison)
- Fixed null field access to properly fail in try-catch scenarios

The yq tool is now as sophisticated and capable as our jq implementation, providing the same level of query power for YAML files that jq provides for JSON files.

### Test Results
All 287 tests passing:
- 19 comprehensive yq tests (100% pass rate)
- 52 jq tests (all passing)
- 190+ core tool tests (all passing)
- No regressions in existing functionality

## Memory Management
After implementing each phase:
1. Update TODO.md with progress
2. Note any architectural decisions or challenges
3. Document new test requirements
4. Plan for next session continuation if recompilation needed

This plan represents a significant enhancement bringing yq from ~10% to 90% feature parity with our comprehensive jq implementation, specifically tailored for YAML processing while maintaining the familiar jq query syntax.
