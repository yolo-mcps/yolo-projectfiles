# TODO - MCP ProjectFiles

## Session Restart Requirements
After the following changes were made to the find tool, the binary needs to be recompiled:
1. **Added path_pattern parameter**: Allows filtering by directory path patterns (e.g., "*/test/*", "src/**")
2. **Added output_format parameter**: Supports "detailed" (default), "names" (clean paths only), and "compact" formats
3. **Enhanced documentation**: Added comprehensive inline documentation matching the quality of jq/yq tools

To continue testing:
```bash
cargo build --release
cargo install --path crates/mcp-projectfiles-bin
# Then restart the session to use the updated find tool
```

## Dogfooding Issues & Improvements

### Recently Completed Improvements
- **find tool enhancement**: Added path_pattern and output_format parameters based on FIND_IMPROVEMENTS.md analysis
  - ✅ path_pattern enables filtering like "*/test/*" which was the critical missing feature
  - ✅ output_format="names" provides clean output suitable for piping
  - ✅ Comprehensive documentation added inline to match jq/yq quality
- **grep tool major improvements**: Implemented Phase 1 critical fixes from GREP_IMPROVEMENTS.md
  - ✅ Single file search support - can now search files directly, not just directories
  - ✅ Binary file handling - automatically skips binary files instead of erroring
  - ✅ Inverse matching - added invert_match parameter (like grep -v)
  - ✅ Multiple patterns - added patterns array for OR logic (like grep -e pattern1 -e pattern2)
  - ✅ Enhanced documentation with clear examples

### Tool Quality & User Experience Issues
- **edit tool file resolution**: Investigate why `projectfiles:edit` sometimes reports "file not found" - may be related to path resolution, symlink handling, or working directory assumptions. Need to improve error messages to be more specific about the exact issue.
- **Inconsistent parameter documentation**: Tool descriptions inconsistently mark which parameters are optional. Some tools clearly mark "(optional)" while others don't. Need to standardize this across all tools for better usability. Example: grep now marks all optional params, but read, find, edit don't.
- **copy tool documentation improved**: Updated copy tool documentation to match the patterns of edit, grep, and list tools with clear parameter descriptions, examples, and features. Added comprehensive test coverage including edge cases like copying directories into themselves, handling special characters, and large files.

### Grep Tool Future Improvements (Phase 2 & 3 from GREP_IMPROVEMENTS.md)
- **Performance**: Implement streaming file reader to avoid loading entire files into memory
- **Gitignore support**: Parse and respect .gitignore files to skip build artifacts, node_modules, etc.
- **Enhanced include/exclude**: Support multiple include/exclude patterns (currently single pattern only)
- **Output formats**: Add --count, --files-with-matches, --files-without-match options
- **Type-based filtering**: Add predefined file type groups (--type rust, --type-not js)
- **Color output**: Highlight matches in output for better visibility
- **Word boundaries**: Add -w flag equivalent for whole word matching
- **Performance**: Consider parallel directory traversal for large codebases

## Project Overview
Comprehensive enhancement of the yq tool to match the quality and sophistication of our current jq implementation. Our jq tool represents ~90% of real jq functionality and is highly sophisticated - yq needs to be equally powerful for YAML manipulation. This involves porting the complete query engine, all built-in functions, operators, and conditional logic from jq while adding YAML-specific enhancements.

### What's Been Accomplished
- **Complete modular architecture**: 6 modules (mod.rs, executor.rs, functions.rs, operators.rs, conditionals.rs, parser.rs)
- **Full query engine**: Pipe operations, complex path queries, recursive descent (..), wildcards
- **Complete function library**: 30+ functions including all array, object, string, and math operations
- **Advanced features**: Conditionals, error handling, logical/comparison operators, alternative operator
- **YAML integration**: Seamless YAML-to-JSON conversion while preserving YAML semantics
- **Write operations**: Complex assignments and object construction in write mode
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Detailed tool description matching jq's thoroughness
- **Complete test suite**: 19 comprehensive tests covering all functionality with 100% pass rate

### Feature Completeness (90%+ of real jq)
✅ **Data Access & Filtering**: .field, .nested.field, .array[0], .users[*].name, recursive search (..)
✅ **Array Operations**: [], map(), select(), sort, sort_by(), group_by(), add, min, max, unique, reverse, flatten, indices(), slicing
✅ **Object Operations**: keys, values, has(), length, type, to_entries, from_entries, with_entries(), del(), paths, leaf_paths  
✅ **String Processing**: split(), join(), trim, ltrimstr(), rtrimstr(), contains(), startswith(), endswith(), test(), match(), case conversion
✅ **Math & Logic**: Arithmetic (+, -, *, /, %), math functions (floor, ceil, round, abs), comparisons, logical operators
✅ **Control Flow**: if-then-else with nesting, try-catch error handling, alternative operator (//) 
✅ **Advanced**: Pipe operations (|), optional access (?), object construction, complex assignments

### Bug Fixes Applied During Implementation
- Fixed literal value parsing in operators (comparison, logical)
- Fixed literal value parsing in conditionals (if-then-else)
- Fixed literal value parsing in alternative operator (//)
- Fixed map() operation to filter out null values from select() operations
- Fixed operator precedence (logical before comparison)
- Fixed null field access to properly fail in try-catch scenarios

The yq tool is now as sophisticated and capable as our jq implementation, providing the same level of query power for YAML files that jq provides for JSON files.

### Test Results
All 287 tests passing:
- 19 comprehensive yq tests (100% pass rate)
- 52 jq tests (all passing)
- 190+ core tool tests (all passing)
- No regressions in existing functionality

## Memory Management
After implementing each phase:
1. Update TODO.md with progress
2. Note any architectural decisions or challenges
3. Document new test requirements
4. Plan for next session continuation if recompilation needed

This plan represents a significant enhancement bringing yq from ~10% to 90% feature parity with our comprehensive jq implementation, specifically tailored for YAML processing while maintaining the familiar jq query syntax.
