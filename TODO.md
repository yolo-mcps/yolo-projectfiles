# TODO - MCP ProjectFiles

## Session Restart Requirements
After the following changes were made to the find tool, the binary needs to be recompiled:
1. **Improved documentation**: Updated to follow standardized patterns from edit, grep, and list tools
   - Added explicit "(optional)" markers for all optional parameters
   - Added comprehensive examples section with common use cases
   - Improved parameter descriptions with clear examples
2. **Enhanced test coverage**: Added 6 new test cases
   - Path pattern filtering tests
   - Output format tests (names, compact, detailed)
   - Date filter tests
   - Combined filter tests
   - Invalid parameter validation tests

To continue testing:
```bash
cargo build --release
cargo install --path crates/mcp-projectfiles-bin
# Then restart the session to use the updated find tool
```

## Dogfooding Issues & Improvements

### Recently Completed Improvements
- **find tool enhancement**: Comprehensive improvements based on FIND_IMPROVEMENTS.md analysis
  - ✅ Documentation standardization - follows patterns from edit, grep, and list tools
  - ✅ All optional parameters now explicitly marked with "(optional)"
  - ✅ Added detailed examples section with common use cases and output format explanations
  - ✅ Enhanced test coverage - added 6 new test cases covering path patterns, output formats, date filters, combined filters, and invalid parameters
  - ✅ Tool already had path_pattern and output_format features which address the critical gaps
  - ✅ Created FIND_IMPROVEMENTS_V2.md documenting potential future enhancements for agentic LLMs
- **grep tool major improvements**: Implemented Phase 1 critical fixes from GREP_IMPROVEMENTS.md
  - ✅ Single file search support - can now search files directly, not just directories

  - ✅ Inverse matching - added invert_match parameter (like grep -v)
  - ✅ Multiple patterns - added patterns array for OR logic (like grep -e pattern1 -e pattern2)
  - ✅ Enhanced documentation with clear examples

### Future Find Tool Improvements (from FIND_IMPROVEMENTS_V2.md)
- **Exclude pattern support**: Add exclude_pattern parameter to filter out common directories like node_modules, target, .git
- **File content preview**: Add preview_lines parameter to show first N lines of text files in results
- **Multiple path patterns**: Support path_patterns array for OR logic across multiple locations
- **Git-aware filtering**: Add respect_gitignore parameter to automatically exclude ignored files
- **Result grouping**: Add group_by_directory parameter for better organization of large result sets

### Tool Quality & User Experience Issues
- **edit tool file resolution**: Investigate why `projectfiles:edit` sometimes reports "file not found" - may be related to path resolution, symlink handling, or working directory assumptions. Need to improve error messages to be more specific about the exact issue.
- **Inconsistent parameter documentation**: Tool descriptions inconsistently mark which parameters are optional. Some tools clearly mark "(optional)" while others don't. Need to standardize this across all tools for better usability. Example: grep now marks all optional params, but read, find, edit don't.
- **copy tool documentation improved**: Updated copy tool documentation to match the patterns of edit, grep, and list tools with clear parameter descriptions, examples, and features. Added comprehensive test coverage including edge cases like copying directories into themselves, handling special characters, and large files.
- **file tool documentation improved**: Updated file tool (formerly file_type) documentation to follow standardized patterns from edit, grep, and list tools. Added structured description with NOTE about optional parameters, comprehensive examples section, features list, and clear return value documentation. Parameter comments now consistently marked as "(optional)" where appropriate.
- **delete tool documentation improved**: Updated delete tool documentation to match the patterns of edit, grep, and list tools. Added comprehensive parameter documentation with "(optional)" markers, examples section, and 4 additional test cases for edge cases.
- **diff tool documentation improved**: Enhanced diff tool documentation with structured format, clear parameter descriptions, and comprehensive examples. The tool already has excellent test coverage (20 tests) including symlink handling, whitespace ignoring, and various edge cases.
- **exists tool improvements completed**: 
  - ✅ Updated documentation to follow the standardized pattern of edit, grep, and list tools
  - ✅ Added structured description with NOTE about omitting optional parameters
  - ✅ Added "(optional)" markers to parameter documentation
  - ✅ Added Parameters, Features, Examples, and Returns sections
  - ✅ Added include_metadata parameter for optional size/permissions/timestamps
  - ✅ Added 3 new tests (metadata with/without, nested paths) - total 11 tests
  - ✅ The tool now provides more value for agentic LLMs with metadata support
- **file tool improvements completed** (renamed from file_type):
  - ✅ Documentation already follows standardized pattern from edit, grep, and list tools
  - ✅ Parameter documentation already had "(optional)" markers where appropriate
  - ✅ Already has excellent test coverage (22 tests, now 27 tests)
  - ✅ Added 4 new features useful for agentic coding LLMs:
    - Line ending detection (LF vs CRLF) - important for cross-platform compatibility
    - Shebang detection for executable scripts (e.g., #!/usr/bin/env python3)
    - Programming language identification (30+ languages based on extension and content)
    - Preview of first 5 lines for text files - quick content inspection
  - ✅ Added 5 new test cases for the new features - all tests passing
  - ✅ Fixed line ending detection logic to properly handle CRLF sequences
  - ✅ Renamed tool from "file_type" to "file" to match Unix command

### Grep Tool Future Improvements (Phase 2 & 3 from GREP_IMPROVEMENTS.md)
- **Performance**: Implement streaming file reader to avoid loading entire files into memory
- **Gitignore support**: Parse and respect .gitignore files to skip build artifacts, node_modules, etc.
- **Enhanced include/exclude**: Support multiple include/exclude patterns (currently single pattern only)
- **Output formats**: Add --count, --files-with-matches, --files-without-match options
- **Type-based filtering**: Add predefined file type groups (--type rust, --type-not js)
- **Color output**: Highlight matches in output for better visibility
- **Word boundaries**: Add -w flag equivalent for whole word matching
- **Performance**: Consider parallel directory traversal for large codebases

The yq tool is now as sophisticated and capable as our jq implementation, providing the same level of query power for YAML files that jq provides for JSON files.

### Test Results
All 287 tests passing:
- 19 comprehensive yq tests (100% pass rate)
- 52 jq tests (all passing)
- 190+ core tool tests (all passing)

## Memory Management
After implementing each phase:
1. Update TODO.md with progress
2. Note any architectural decisions or challenges
3. Document new test requirements
4. Plan for next session continuation if recompilation needed

This plan represents a significant enhancement bringing yq from ~10% to 90% feature parity with our comprehensive jq implementation, specifically tailored for YAML processing while maintaining the familiar jq query syntax.
